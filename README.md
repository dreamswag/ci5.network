## 🏴‍☠️ Project Paradigm
**Ci5** is a net-correctional facility for the Raspberry Pi 5.

### The Aim:
* **Physically punish bufferbloat.**
* Excise network telemetry at the kernel level.

### The Reason:
* ISPs sell "Speed" (Throughput) but deliver "Lag" (Latency).
* Consumer routers are bloated surveillance nodes that prioritize marketing data over packet discipline.

### The Purpose:
* **Transform a £70 computer into a serious sovereign routing engine:**
    * Enforcing consistent enterprise-grade security fortification.
    * Establishing 0ms latency under full load as a new norm.
* **Guarantee verifiably that you always have a "clean room" within your digital life:**
    * Rather than optimistically expecting to be left alone by others.
